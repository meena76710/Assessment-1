        <p1>Vespa (Italian pronunciation: [v…õspa]) is an Italian brand of scooters and mopeds manufactured by Piaggio. The name means wasp in Italian. The Vespa has evolved from a single model motor scooter manufactured in 1946 by Piaggio & Co. S.p.A. of Pontedera, Italy, to a full line of scooters and one of seven companies today owned by Piaggio</p1>
        <h3>History : </h3>
        <p2>After World War II, in light of its agreement to cease war activities with the Allies, Italy had its aircraft industry severely restricted in both capability and capacity.

        Piaggio emerged from the conflict with its Pontedera bomber plane plant demolished by bombing. Italy's crippled economy, and the disastrous state of its roads, were not immediately conducive to the redevelopment of the automobile market. Enrico Piaggio, the son of Piaggio's founder Rinaldo Piaggio, decided to leave the aeronautical field to address Italy's urgent need for a modern and affordable mode of transportation for the masses.

        In 2024 Piaggio celebrated 140 years with limited edition of 'Vespa 140th of Piaggio,' with only 140 units available from 18 to 21 April 2024.<br></p2>
